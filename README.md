# Multimodal-RAG-Application

This repository provides a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that leverages the **LLAMA Vision Model** via **Together AI** as a generator model and **ColPali** model as a retrieval model.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

### 1. Install dependencies

```

### 3. Install Poppler utilities
Poppler utilities are required for PDF processing. Install them using:
